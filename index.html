    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The growing number of personal vehicles in urban areas near workplaces has led to parking challenges, causing gridlock and congestion. An intelligent parking management system, guided by IoT principles, aims to alleviate these issues. This system incorporates machine learning, cloud computing, networking, embedded systems, and web development. It features a web portal for real-time parking updates, CCTV for vehicle security, and parking utilization analysis. Additionally, it includes a license plate recognition device to reduce search time, fuel consumption, traffic, and pollution. Improved parking availability enhances productivity and positively impacts the economy.</p>
